# FF_SmsServer
ESP8266/A6-GA6 SMS server with HTTP/MQTT/Serial interfaces

## What's for?
This code implements an SMS gateway, based on ESP8266 and A6/GA6 GSM modem chip (other may work too).

Messages to send are read on Serial and/or MQTT and/or HTTP.

Received SMS from restricted phone numbers are pushed to Serial and/or MQTT. With associated examples:
	- it's possible to execute bash commands on remote Unix nodes,
	- as well as reading/changing state of Domoticz devices.

It may have an external relay/NPN to power cycle and reset GSM chip, or a direct connection to modem's reset pin.

It may also have external watchdog circuit (https://github.com/FlyingDomotic/FF_Watchdog being a good idea).

It uses FF_WebServer (https://github.com/FlyingDomotic/FF_WebServer) to implement a fully asynchronous Web server with:
	- MQTT connection
	- Arduino and Web OTA
	- local file system to host user and server files
	- file and/or browser based settings
	- full file editor/upload/download
	- optional telnet or serial or MQTT debug commands
	- optional serial and/or syslog trace
	- optional external hardware watchdog
	- optional Domoticz connectivity

Used ESP8266 PIN:
	- D1 connected on isolation relay or A6 reset pin (optional)
	- D4 connected to hardware watchdog trigger pin (optional)
	- D5 connected on A6 U_RX PIN
	- D6 connected on A6 U_TX PIN

## Prerequisites

Can be used directly with Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

The following libraries are used:

## Installation

Clone repository somewhere on your disk.
```
cd <where_you_want_to_install_it>
git clone https://github.com/FlyingDomotic/FF_SmsServer.git FF_SmsServer
```

Note that <where_you_want_to_install_it> could ingeniously be your compiler libraries folder ;-)

## Update

Go to code folder and pull new version:
```
cd <where_you_installed_FF_SmsServer>
git pull
```

Note: if you did any changes to files and `git pull` command doesn't work for you anymore, you could stash all local changes using:
```
git stash
```
or
```
git checkout <modified file>
```

Warning: as files in data folder should be downloaded on ESP file system, it may be a good idea to check if some of them have been changed be a new version, to update them on your ESP.

Remind also that config.json and userconfig.json are specific to your installation. Don't forget to download them from your ESP before making a global file system upload.

## Documentation

Documentation could be built using doxygen, either using makedoc.sh (for Linux) or makedoc.bat (for Windows), or running
```
doxygen doxyfile
```

HTML and RTF versions will then be available in `documentation` folder.

## How to send a SMS?

You may send a SMS:
	- making an HTTP request at `http://[smsserver name or ip]/rest/send&number=[phone number]&message=[message to send]`. As this is an HTTP request, elements have to be escaped as usual (i.e replace spaces by +, special characters by their equivalents).
	- sending `{"number":"[phone number of target]", "message":"[Message to send outside]"}` to  to MQTT topic `mqttGetTopic` (probably something like `smsServer/toSend`)
	- sending messages like `{"number":"[phone number of target]", "message":"[Message to send outside]"}` to Serial. Answer format will be `{"status":"[submission status]"}`.

## How to get a SMS?
	- subscribing to MQTT `mqttSendTopic` (probably something like `smsServer/received`). Received message format is `{"number":"[phone number of sender]", "date":"[receive date]", "message":"[Message sent to SMS server]"}`.
	- scanning Serial for messages like `{"number":"[phone number of sender]", "date":"[receive date]", "message":"[Message sent to SMS server]"}`

## Debug commands

Debug commands are available to help understanding what happens, and may be a good starting point to help troubleshooting.

Debug output is available on Telnet, Serial and Syslog. Note that settings can disable some of these outputs.

### Access
Debug is available through:
- Telnet: connect with a telnet tool on ESP's port 23, and strike commands on keyboard
- MQTT: send the raw command to mqttCommandTopic (don't set the retain flag unless you want the command to be executed at each ESP restart)
- Serial: send the command on Serial, prefixing it by SERIAL_COMMAND_PREFIX (i.e. `command:vars`)

### Commands
The following commands are allowed:
	- ? or h: display these help of commands
	- m: display memory available
	- v: set debug level to verbose
	- d: set debug level to debug
	- i: set debug level to info
	- w: set debug level to warning
	- e: set debug level to errors
	- s: set debug silence on/off
	- cpu80 : ESP8266 CPU at 80MHz
	- cpu160: ESP8266 CPU at 160MHz

## MQTT topics

The following MQTT topics are used:

### MQTTTopic

Base MQTT topic, used to write LWT topic of SMS server
For example: `smsServer`
LWT format: when SMS server active: `{"state":"up","version":"[SMS server version],[FF_WebServer version]"}` , when down: `{"state":"down"}`

### mqttSendTopic

MQTT topic used by SMS server to write received SMS to
For example: `smsServer/received`
Format: `{"number":"[phone number of sender]", "date":"[receive date"], "message":"[Message sent to SMS server]"}`

### mqttGetTopic

MQTT topic used by SMS server to read SMS messages to send to external destination
For example: `smsServer/toSend`
Format: `{"number":"[phone number to send message to]", "message":"[Message to send]"}`

### mqttLwtTopic

Root MQTT last will topic to to read application status
For example: `smsServer/LWT` (will be followed by node/application name, i.e. `smsServer/LWT/myNode`)
Format: `{"state":"[State of node/application]"}`, probably "up" or "down", displayed on main Web server page, and returned to answer of `/rest/listening` request

### mqttCommandTopic

MQTT topic to read debug commands to be executed
For example: `smsServer/command`
Format: `[Command to be executed]` List of available commands can be returned sending "?" or "h" command

## Associated files

Here's list of associated files

### examples/readSms.py

This example reads SMS and send them back to receiver, prefixing them with "Received :".
Basically useless, but a good starting point to be used as example for your own code.

### examples/smsHandler.py

Reads received SMS through MQTT, to isolate messages starting with this node name. 
When found, rest of message is executed as OS local command.
Result, output and errors are then sent back by mail.
If answer is shorter than 70 characters, it will be also sent back by SMS.
Else result code will be sent back to sender.
Traces are kept in a log file, rotated each week.

MQTT and mail settings are to be set into file before running it, probably as a service.
